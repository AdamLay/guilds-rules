Wounds

## Vanquished Models

Models who collect enough Wounds to match their MIGHT score are immediately Vanquished and removed from the game.  
This doesn’t happen so simply for Heroes, as seen in the _Heroic Wounds_ section.
At the end of a Quests, Vanquished models are calculated to obtain Victory Points (as we will see in the chapter on Campaigns).

## Resurrection

Models who are not Vanquished are considered In Game, as Vanquished models are placed outside of the gaming table.  
Specific Abilities might get back into the game models during a Quest to let them fight for more rounds, these effects are said to Resurrect a model.  
Unless specified otherwise, these models are Resurrected in the same spot they were Vanquished, with no Wounds, Heroic Wounds or any kind of other Token on it.

## Campaign Casualties

During a Campaign, models (or even full Cards) that are Vanquished at the end of each Quest return to the player's disposal in the next Quest, unless specified otherwise.

## Heroic Wounds

_Wounds which would normally kill a soldier or mercenary are not enough to stop a Hero, legendary commanders, warriors and arcanists who have the ability to withstand the most ferocious wounds and survive._  

Heroes, Heroic Mounts and Heroic Beasts have in fact an attribute called Heroism.
Everytime a model with Heroism gets enough Wounds to match its Might it doesn’t get Vanquished, it instead receives a _Heroic Wound Token_.
Each Wound that exceeds the Might is accumulated as a regular Wound, with the possibility of adding up to future Wounds and thus transforming into an additional Heroic Wound.  

In short, a model with Heroism gets a Heroic Wound every X Wounds, where X stands to its Might (everytime he should be Vanquished).  

This generates the possibility that enough Wounds are being inflicted to match the Might multiple times, inflicting more Heroic Wounds.
The Heroic Wounds Tokens are collected on the Model Card.  

When enough Heroic Wounds are collected on the Model Card to match or surpass his Heroism, the model is removed from the gaming table (exactly how normal models are Vanquished).  

```{hint}
Example: Khaladas the Soulsplitter (5 DEF, 3 MIGHT, 3 Heroism) is being Attacked by a Dragonpeak Barbarian.  
The Barbarian rolls 3 ATK and obtains a 5, a 5 and a 6. 5 are 2 Success (2 Wounds) and 6 a Critical Hit (2 Wounds); the Barbarian Attack inflicts 4 Wounds: it matches Khaladas Might, inflicting him 1 Heroic Wound and 1 additional Wound.  
Khaladas survived this Attack Action who would have Vanquished a normal Inquisitor, but having 3 Heroism is still alive and can receive more.  

During another round, the Barbarian makes a Formation with other 2 Dragonpeak Barbarians and the three Attack during the same Attack Action Khaladas.  
By rolling all at once, they generate a total of 5 Wounds. 5 Wounds are not enough to match the Might of the enemy Hero 2 times, but lucky for the Barbarians, Khaladas is already carrying an Heroic Wound and a regular Wound from a previous Round, and so he is slain and removed from the game collecting a total of 3 Heroic Wounds.
