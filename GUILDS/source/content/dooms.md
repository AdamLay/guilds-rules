Dooms
=====

The hearts and courage of heroic models let
them face the toughest shocks, where any
other soldier or mercenary would yield or give
up. Withstanding brutal combat, witnessing
unspeakable terrors or through Arcane
Instability, Heroic models accumulate
Torment which eventually gain them Dooms.
Dooms are mental states that are often afflictions and rarely virtues.


## Torment Tokens (TT)

Torment Tokens, abbreviated as TT, represent a Hero, Heroic Mount or Heroic Beasts’s mental damage and pressure, in fact, regular models don’t use it.  
Torment Tokens can’t exceed the WILL score of a heroic model.
A heroic model (even Arcanists) who accumulates enough Torment Tokens to reach their WILL has to immediately roll a random Doom from the List.

## Sources of Torment

Torment Tokens are received by Heroes, Heroic Mounts or Heroic Beasts from a variety of situations and sources:

* Guildmasters accumulate 1 TT at the end of the Round if their Shouted Orders are not accomplished.
* When a model tagged Arcanist casts a Spell.
* By using an Active Abilities marked with a “(T)”, 1 TT is accumulated on the Model Card using it.
* Various Spells inflict TT instead of Wounds.
* Some specific Terrain, Quests Special Rules or Artifacts could inflict Torment Tokens.

## Doom Roll List

Heroic models are affected by collected Dooms until the end of the Campaign if you are playing one.
Otherwise, they last until the end of the current Game. Campaign sheets let you keep track of your heroic model's Dooms, which also come in Cards to collect.  
Once a heroic model rolls a Doom, the Torment Tokens are completely removed.
Heroic models can’t get more than 1 Doom.
When a heroic model affected by a Doom accumulates enough Torment Tokens to reach their Will he has to roll a random Doom from the list again.  
The new Doom assigned replaces the previously owned Doom, but if it turns out to be the same Doom already owned, the heroic model will be immediately Vanquished. 
Once your heroic model needs to roll to receive a Doom, roll 2D6, add the results together and consult on the table below.
Assign that Doom to the heroic model that made the roll.
