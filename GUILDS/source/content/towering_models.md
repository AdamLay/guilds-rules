Towering Models
===============

Figures with the size tag Towering are much larger than regular sized models.  
These massive creatures and the models interacting with them are affected by special rules.  

## Charging Towering Models

Regular models who wish to charge a Towering model need to pass a Will Test, unless they are in Formation.  
If the model, even Heroic, fails the test, it can’t charge and engage the target, wasting its Movement.
Heroic models failing this test get 1 Torment.  

Towering models are immune to Impact Force not coming from non-towering models.

## Engaged Towering Models

Towering models don’t need to perform Disengagement to move away from Engaged models, unless they are Towering.
